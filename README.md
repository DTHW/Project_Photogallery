# Project Photo-Gallery
Welcome and thank you for visiting my project.

I enjoyed creating it and I learned some usefull tricks about grid structures as well as creating multple layers for additional effects. <br>
This type of project also gave me the oppertunity to add two of my own pictures into the mix. <br>
You can see those two pictures left and right as they show the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromia_iridum">two different eyes</a> of my dog.

## About the project

<img src="Landing.png" alt="LandingPage"/>

While studying to improve my web development skills this is the first project work on my personal repository.
The idea was to create a photo gallery on the basis of all different kinds you find on the internet.
For my creation I took inspiration from the <a href="https://supsystic.com/example/blackout-gallery-example/">"Blackout Gallery"</a> on supsystic.com.

The framework of this project was that the basics of HTML and CSS are known (minus some of the more advanced things).
I had some ideas to enhance the pictures when clickend on them, without Javascript these seemed to be a bit difficult. 
I worked on a prototype for this, but was not satisfied in the end since everything pointed into the direction of using Javascript in one or another capacity.

I would have loved to integrate the slide-in overlay though it seems that this intertwining with the "dim" effect so I prioritized the dim over the slide-in.
To compromise with that I show the creators name up front and then let them fade out when a picture gets focused on.
