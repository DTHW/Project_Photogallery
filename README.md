# Project_Photogallery
Welcome and thank you for visiting my project. 
I enjoyed creating it and I learned some usefull tricks about grid structures as well as creating multple layers for additional effects.

## About the project

-> Picture of landing page

While studying to improve my web development skills this is the first project work on my personal repository.
The idea was to create a photo gallery on the basis of all different kinds you find on the internet.
For my creation I took inspiration from the "Blackout Gallery" on supsystic.com.

The framework of this project was that the basics of HTML and CSS are known (minus some of the more advanced things).
I had some ideas to enhance the pictures when clickend on them, without Javascript these seemed to be a bit difficult. 
I worked on a prototype for this, but was not satisfied in the end since everything pointed into the direction of using Javascript in one or another capacity.

I would have loved to integrate the slide-in overlay though it seems that this intertwining with the "dim" effect so I prioritized the dim over the slide-in.
To compromise with that I show the creators name up front and then let them fade out when a picture gets focused on.


## Key Features

* Dimmed out pictures until hovered over
* Creator names hidden when picture focus on
* Three different kinds of resolutions supported
  - Mobile view (1 to 600 pixel in width)
  - Tablet view (601 1279 pixel in width)
  - Desktop view (1280 < pixel in width)   
* Reference links to all picture sources
