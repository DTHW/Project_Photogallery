# Project Photo-Gallery ðŸ“·
Welcome and thank you for visiting my project.

I enjoyed creating it and I learned some useful tricks about grid structures as well as creating multiple layers for additional effects. <br>
This type of project also gave me the opportunity to add two of my own pictures into the mix. <br>
You can see those two pictures left and right as they show the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromia_iridum">two different eyes</a> of my dog.

## About the project ðŸ“˜

<img src="Landing.png" alt="LandingPage"/>

While studying to improve my web development skills this is the first project work on my personal repository.
The idea was to create a photo gallery based on all different kinds you find on the internet.
For my creation I took inspiration from the <a href="https://supsystic.com/example/blackout-gallery-example/">"Blackout Gallery"</a> on supsystic.com.

The framework of this project was that the basics of HTML and CSS are known (minus some of the more advanced things).
I had some ideas to enhance the pictures when clicked on them, without JavaScript these seemed to be a bit difficult. 
I worked on a prototype for this but was not satisfied in the end since everything pointed into the direction of using JavaScript in one or another capacity.

I would have loved to integrate the slide-in overlay though it seems that this intertwining with the "dim" effect, so I prioritized the dim over the slide-in.
To compromise with that I show the creators name up front and then let them fade out when a picture gets focused on.

## Key Features ðŸ”‘

* Dimmed out pictures until hovered over
* Creator names hidden when picture focus on
* Three different kinds of resolutions supported
  - Mobile view (1 - 600 pixel in width)
  - Tablet view (601 - 1279 pixel in width)
  - Desktop view (1280 < pixel in width)   
* Reference links to all picture sources

## Planning, Prototyping & Production ðŸš§

As we can see the general structure stayed the same from the first planning image. <br>
In general it was important for me to mark down how the site and especially the grid structure would work out with the different images that I had in mind to use for this project.

While preserving the core structure of the project I wanted to try out some things in regards of enlarging pictures via a click, so I tried to mask some checkboxes within the images itself. <br>
Sadly, this only achieved a moderate success within the given timeframe. 
I managed to enlarge the pictures but was not able to center them in the screen and dim the background simultaneously. 
Another problem came for my vision when I needed something between a checkbox and a radio button. 
I wanted the image to stay enlarged until clicked again to then return to the general structure, but I also did not want multiple pictures enlarged at the same time.
So, I removed this feature from the final product, but with these lessons learned and soon my first steps into JavaScript I will probably resolve those issues in a future project.
The prototype image shows some of my progress regarding what I described.
